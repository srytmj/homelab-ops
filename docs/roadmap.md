# Roadmap

> What's planned, not what exists yet. Move items to CHANGELOG.md once done, and update architecture.md accordingly.

## Now

- [x] Pick and order hardware: Lenovo M710q (i7-7700, 32GB RAM), LM418 + M.2-SATA adapter, Seagate Barracuda 2TB HDD + external dock, Enhance ENP-2320 PSU + 24-pin jumper + Molex-to-SATA cables, TP-Link TL-LS1005G switch — no dedicated router this round (see decisions.md for actual cart prices)
- [x] Buy: HDD-Media (1TB, 2.5") and HDD-Cloud (1TB, 3.5") — purchased, exact model/price to log later
- [x] Source a multi-bay dock/enclosure for HDD-Media + HDD-Cloud — purchased, exact model/price to log later
- [ ] Source a small mount/dock solution for HDD-Backup (WD Blue 320GB) — the 4th drive, beyond the original 3-drive dock plan
- [ ] Physically assemble: OS SSD (M.2 SATA) into internal 2.5" bay via adapter; LM418 into M.2 slot; all 4 HDDs (Music/Media/Cloud/Backup) wired to LM418's SATA ports (4 of 5 used) into their dock(s); docks powered by the Enhance ENP-2320 (with 24-pin jumper installed so it powers on without a motherboard) via Molex-to-SATA cables; 3 reused PC fans wired to the PSU's spare Molex outputs for dock cooling; route cables through open backplate, cover RAM opening with magnetic mesh
- [x] Install Proxmox VE on M710q — done 2026-09-11, `pve.suryatmaja.dev` (192.168.18.224). Note: installed CPU verified as i5-7500 (4C/4T), not the purchased i7-7700 (4C/8T) — see architecture.md, unresolved discrepancy.
- [x] Create docker-host LXC (Ubuntu Server 24.04) — done 2026-09-11, LXC 100 (192.168.18.225), `nesting=1,keyctl=1` enabled, Docker Engine + Compose installed and verified
- [ ] Mount all 4 HDDs: `/mnt/hdd-music/`, `/mnt/hdd-media/`, `/mnt/hdd-cloud/`, `/mnt/hdd-backup/` (each single drive, no RAID — see decisions.md). Spare 1TB 2.5" HDD stays unallocated for now.
- [x] Deploy Nginx Proxy Manager — done 2026-09-11, chosen over Traefik (user preference — GUI-first). First proxy host added: `portainer.home.arpa` → Portainer.
- [x] Deploy shared PostgreSQL + Redis — done 2026-09-11
- [ ] Deploy first batch of the 10 web projects — **started 2026-09-11: `portfolio` deployed** (`yorha-portfolio` container, port 3080, on docker-host). The other 9 not yet deployed.
- [ ] Give each Tailscale-only service its own subdomain (Tailscale MagicDNS/Serve) so the portfolio's hidden dashboard page can link to clean per-service hrefs

- [ ] Set up Samba share on `/mnt/hdd-cloud/shared/` for Windows File Explorer network access
- [x] Add hidden dashboard page to the existing `portfolio` repo — done (built in a separate Claude Code session); URLs still need to be filled in with real Tailscale subdomains once services are actually deployed
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Tunnel to expose `portfolio` publicly — **sequencing decision (2026-09-11): this now happens AFTER Tailscale is installed and every service has a Tailscale address, not before.** The user will personally bridge `portfolio`'s Tailscale address to a Cloudflare Tunnel themselves — Claude Code should not deploy `cloudflared` unprompted. See the "Next" section's Tailscale item, which now blocks this one.

## Next

- [ ] Deploy media stack: Jellyfin (movies/TV/anime + music), Nextcloud, Kavita
- [x] Set up Tailscale for remote access — done 2026-09-11, docker-host joined tailnet `srytmj.github` as `100.89.249.96` / `docker-host.taila813af.ts.net`. **Still open:** per-service MagicDNS subdomains via `tailscale serve` (see the "Now" section item above), and bridging individual services to Cloudflare Tunnel (user will do this personally per service, not Claude Code).
- [x] Set up Uptime Kuma + Netdata for monitoring — done 2026-09-11 (ports 3001, 19999). Scrutiny still pending — needs real HDDs with SMART data, not physically assembled yet.
- [ ] Set up automated backup (Restic): DB dumps + config → **HDD-Backup** (WD Blue 320GB, physically separate dedicated drive); Nextcloud file data → **VaultS3**, cross-drive from HDD-Cloud (see decisions.md — must not target the same physical drive as the source).
- [ ] Set up rclone → Google Drive (idle 5TB, AI Pro) as offsite (Tier 2) backup target for Restic — dedicated Google Cloud API client (not rclone's shared default), scheduled sync via new script + systemd timer (not a live mount). No added monthly cost.
- [ ] Update `scripts/backup.sh` to target `/mnt/hdd-backup/` instead of the old external-enclosure path

- [ ] homelab-sentinel: Telegram bot (Python, `python-telegram-bot`) — consolidates monitoring alerts + interactive queries + whitelisted management + short QnA (Gemini API free tier). Built in a separate Claude Code session, not this repo's setup flow. See decisions.md for the 3-tier capability design and guardrails (whitelist commands only, NOT arbitrary LLM execution). Needs: Telegram bot token (@BotFather), Gemini API key (AI Studio).
- [ ] T3 Code ([pingdotgg/t3code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code)) — **priority raised from "Later/Ideas"** (2026-09-11). Deploy Claude Code CLI + T3 Code on docker-host, Tailscale-only, so the user can drive Claude Code sessions from mobile/web without a laptop present. Still behind current top priority (HDD migration/assembly — see "Now" section) — not started yet.

- [ ] Deploy Syncthing (file sync)
- [ ] Deploy Shiori (bookmark manager)
- [ ] Deploy YOURLS (URL shortener)
- [ ] Deploy n8n (workflow automation)
- [ ] Deploy Alexandrie (self-hosted knowledge base / notes)
- [ ] Deploy Vaultwarden (password manager — lightweight community rewrite, NOT the official bitwarden/server which is heavier)
- [ ] Deploy Firefly III (personal finance/budgeting tracker)
- [ ] Deploy Home Assistant (once the smart power plug with HA support arrives)
- [ ] Deploy Homelable (self-hosted infra visualizer — network diagram + live health-check status, complements Uptime Kuma/homelab-sentinel)
- [ ] Deploy Reclip (self-hosted media downloader, yt-dlp wrapper with web UI)
- [ ] Deploy LibreSpeed (self-hosted speed test, for checking PC↔Homelab LAN speed and WAN speed)
- [ ] Deploy VaultS3 (lightweight S3-compatible object storage, for apps/backups that want an S3 target without paying for cloud storage)
- [ ] Evaluate Databasus as a replacement for `scripts/backup.sh` — adds PITR + restore verification + notifications (Discord/Slack/Telegram) vs. the current plain pg_dump script
- [ ] Deploy qBittorrent (torrent client, web UI) — no VPN wrapper for now, see decisions.md for the cost/risk trade-off; revisit adding Gluetun + Mullvad later if budget allows
- [ ] Deploy SnapOtter — self-hosted file-processing toolkit (200+ tools: convert/compress/OCR/transcribe across image/video/audio/PDF). Standing service, bundles its own Postgres 17 + Redis (not the shared ones). Cap concurrent job workers — video transcode/OCR are CPU-heavy on the GPU-less M710q. Replaces the FileWizard plan.
- [ ] (no hosting needed) CodeFlow — single-HTML architecture-map tool, run locally by opening its `index.html`, not deployed to docker-host

## After base homelab is up and stable

- [ ] Deploy CapRover — mini hosting panel for friends to self-deploy their own CRUD web apps (~15 apps planned, school/report assignments, low/no traffic — not public production apps). Requires Docker Swarm mode alongside the existing docker-compose setup. Set conservative per-app resource caps (~256-512MB each) as a safety net even though actual load is expected to be light.
- [ ] Deploy MySQL/MariaDB via CapRover's One-Click Apps catalog, dedicated to the friends'-apps pool — **separate instance from the existing shared PostgreSQL/Redis** used by the user's own 10 projects, since these are a different trust boundary
- [ ] Extend the Cloudflare Tunnel (already set up for `portfolio`) to also expose each friend's CapRover-hosted app publicly — second exception to Tailscale-only, same tunnel infrastructure reused

## Later / Ideas

- [ ] k3s sandbox environment (separate LXC, for learning Kubernetes — not for production)
- [ ] VLAN isolation between homelab and personal devices
- [ ] Jellyfin hardware transcode setup if a GPU-capable device becomes available
- [ ] CI/CD: GitHub Actions auto-deploy to homelab on push
