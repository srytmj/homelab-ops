# Roadmap

> What's planned, not what exists yet. Move items to CHANGELOG.md once done, and update architecture.md accordingly.

## Now

- [ ] Automate periodic `pct fstrim` across all LXCs on `pve` (cron/systemd timer on the host) — `local-lvm` thin pool silently bloats from undiscarded deleted blocks otherwise; a one-off run on 2026-09-21 dropped usage from 88.80% to 55.24% (see `CHANGELOG.md` (66)), this will recur without automation.
- [x] Deploy first batch of the 10 web projects — **started 2026-09-11: `portfolio` deployed** (`portofolio` container, port 3080, on docker-host) and `yado` (was `whitearchive`) on `yado-hosts` (LXC 101, was `whitearchive-hosts`). **`malas`, `sso-yado`, `pore-js` all deployed 2026-09-18** on the same host — see `docs/services.md`.

## Next

- [ ] `homelab-cockpit`: on-demand disk usage treemap visualizer (WizTree-style) for `/mnt/hdd-media`, `/mnt/hdd-cloud`, `/mnt/hdd-music` — manual trigger only, no auto-polling (per the 2026-09-15 (3) Docker-overhead lesson). Backend: `dust`/`gdu` instead of plain `du`. Being worked on in a separate `homelab-cockpit` session as of 2026-09-21.
- [ ] `rclone crypt` remote on Google Drive for encrypted offsite cold-backup of music/manga/video (see `docs/decisions.md` 2026-09-20 plan) — no longer blocked: rescue finished (`CHANGELOG.md` (57)-(59)) and `hdd-music`'s role is finalized as cold-backup regardless of RMA outcome (69). Ready to start whenever.
- [ ] `fio` post-mortem stress test on `hdd-music` to find a rough safe-usage-pattern guideline (see `docs/decisions.md` 2026-09-21 plan) — only relevant if the drive stays in service long-term; low priority.
- [ ] Seller RMA conversation for `hdd-music` — sent, no response as of 2026-09-21. User decided not to keep chasing it; revisit if/when the seller replies, otherwise drop.
- [ ] Connect rclone OAuth to Google Drive (idle 5TB, AI Pro) — headless OAuth setup pending.
- [ ] homelab-sentinel: Telegram bot (Python, `python-telegram-bot`) — consolidates monitoring alerts + interactive queries + whitelisted management + short QnA (Gemini API free tier). Needs: Telegram bot token (@BotFather), Gemini API key (AI Studio).
- [ ] Deploy Home Assistant (once the smart power plug with HA support arrives)
- [ ] Deploy VaultS3 (lightweight S3-compatible object storage) — waiting for cross-drive placement.
- [ ] Deploy SnapOtter — self-hosted file-processing toolkit (200+ tools: convert/compress/OCR/transcribe across image/video/audio/PDF).
- [ ] (no hosting needed) CodeFlow — single-HTML architecture-map tool.

## After base homelab is up and stable

- [ ] Deploy CapRover — mini hosting panel for friends to self-deploy their own CRUD web apps (~15 apps planned).
- [ ] Deploy MySQL/MariaDB via CapRover's One-Click Apps catalog, dedicated to the friends'-apps pool.
- [ ] Extend Cloudflare Tunnel for CapRover apps.

## Later / Ideas

- [ ] k3s sandbox environment (separate LXC, for learning Kubernetes — not for production)
- [ ] VLAN isolation between homelab and personal devices
