# Homelab Operations - Instructions for Claude Code, Antigravity & All AI Agents

## Context

This repo manages a homelab server (Lenovo ThinkCentre M710q Tiny — purchased as i7-7700 4C/8T,
but the CPU physically installed verified as i5-7500 4C/4T, unresolved discrepancy, see
`docs/architecture.md` — 32GB RAM). Full current spec and topology: see `docs/architecture.md`.

Server runs Proxmox VE (hypervisor) + Docker (inside 1 Ubuntu LXC, `docker-host`), hosting a
growing list of personal web projects, a media stack (Jellyfin, Nextcloud, Komga), shared PostgreSQL + Redis, and self-hosted tools. **`docs/services.md` is the actual current/planned service list.**

## Before doing anything

0. **`git pull` first, every session, before reading anything else or making any change.**
   This repo is worked on across multiple devices and parallel AI agents. Local files can be stale the moment a session starts. Never trust a file's on-disk state without pulling first.
1. Read `CURRENT_OPS.md` to ensure no active file or container lock exists from another agent.
2. Read `docs/architecture.md` for current infrastructure state (source of truth for "what exists now").
3. Read `docs/roadmap.md` for planned next steps (source of truth for "what's planned").
4. Read `docs/decisions.md` if unsure why something is configured a certain way.
5. Read ONLY the top 20-30 lines of `CHANGELOG.md` (`head -n 30 CHANGELOG.md`). Never read the full file (wastes 16k+ tokens).

Never assume the state of the server — always verify via SSH before making changes.

## Multi-Agent / Multi-Tool Synchronization Rules (STRICT)

Multiple AI agents (Claude Code, Google Antigravity/Gemini, Roo Code, Cursor, etc.) operate on this repository in parallel. There is NO shared runtime memory between different AI sessions. **Git + `CURRENT_OPS.md` + `CHANGELOG.md` is the sole source of truth.**

### 🛑 0. SESSION SCOPE & USER APPROVAL RULE (STRICT)
- **Homelab-Ops Session Boundary**: Sessions in this repository are strictly for **homelab administration, infrastructure, operations, monitoring, and maintenance**. DO NOT create or scaffold new applications or codebases from scratch inside this repository/session. Creating new projects/applications must be done in a separate session/workspace by the user.
- **Mandatory "Analyze First, Confirm Before Execution" Rule**:
  - For every user request (whether deleting files, modifying directories, changing configurations, moving data, restarting services, etc.): **AI MUST perform analysis first and present the plan to the user**.
  - **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** to execute changes, deletions, or filesystem/container mutations directly without **requesting explicit confirmation and approval from the user beforehand**.
- **Mandatory User Confirmation Before Editing Code/Containers**: If there is a need to alter application code, edit running project configurations, modify container environments, or restart/remove containers, **it is MANDATORY to consult and obtain explicit permission from the USER first**. Never bypass this or directly code/deploy without user approval.

### 🚨 1. TASK REGISTRY & LOCKING (`CURRENT_OPS.md`)
- **Claim Before Touch**: If you are about to modify a container, service configuration (`configs/docker-compose/*.yml`), or critical doc, record your active task and lock target in `CURRENT_OPS.md`:
  `"- [Agent-Name] [Timestamp]: Modifying <service> | Locks: <files/containers>"`
- **Respect Active Locks**: If another agent has locked a service or file in `CURRENT_OPS.md`, do NOT touch it until released.
- **Release Promptly**: As soon as the task is finished and verified, clear your lock from `CURRENT_OPS.md`, log to `CHANGELOG.md`, and commit/push.

### ⚡ 2. EXECUTION PERFORMANCE & TOKEN EFFICIENCY
1. **Never Allow Tool Commands to Hang or Spawn Ghost Tasks**:
   - Always set `WaitMsBeforeAsync: 10000` (max sync) or run bounded commands (`timeout 30s ...`).
   - Never run `pct reboot` over blocking SSH inside the same container being rebooted.
2. **One-Shot Batched SSH Scripts**:
   - Instead of running 5-10 separate sequential read/check commands, batch inspection and execution into a single clean Bash heredoc script over SSH (`ssh docker-host 'bash -s' << 'EOF' ... EOF`).
3. **Strict Token Conservation**:
   - **DO NOT read full `CHANGELOG.md`** (~65KB). Only read `head -n 30 CHANGELOG.md`.
   - Restrict log outputs (`docker logs --tail 30 ...`, `git log -n 5`, `docker ps --format ...`).
   - Keep conversational explanations direct, concise, and factual.
4. **Strict Server-Side Background Execution for Long-Running Tasks (Zero Local Load & Non-Blocking AI Session)**:
   - **MANDATORY** to execute all long-running operations (such as auditing thousands of files, large rsync jobs, tagging scans, transcoding, etc.) **directly on the server side as independent background processes** (`nohup python3 /root/... > /root/task.log 2>&1 &` or via systemd).
   - **Non-blocking AI Session**: The AI agent session **MUST NOT** hang or wait for hours in the foreground. Once a background task is running on the server (`nohup`), the AI agent must immediately report that the task is active, allowing the session to continue handling other questions or tasks without obstruction.
   - The user's PC session acts purely as a lightweight monitoring client (zero local CPU/RAM/SMB load). Server progress continues unimpeded even if the AI session or local PC is powered off.
5. **Strict No-Polling Rule (Prevent ACP RPC Deadlock & Cancel Failures)**:
   - **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** to run active polling loops in bash (`while ...; do sleep 2; done`, `sleep X && check`).
   - **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** to make repetitive tool calls (`view_file` on task logs, loop `ps aux`, etc.) while waiting for long-running commands (`docker build`, `docker pull`, large downloads).
   - Once a command transitions to an asynchronous background task, **THE AI MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP CALLING TOOLS**. Let the reactive wakeup event automatically resume execution upon completion.
   - Violating this rule floods the ACP JSON-RPC harness queue, causing freezes and failing to respond to user cancellation signals (`ACP transport operation call-rpc failed for method session/cancel`).

### 🛡️ 3. ANTI-HALLUCINATION & LIVE VERIFICATION
1. **Never Hallucinate / Guess Server State**:
   - Do NOT assume a service is running, installed, or broken based on outdated chat history or training assumptions.
   - **ALWAYS check live server state first** via SSH (`docker ps`, `systemctl status`, `df -h`, `ls -la`) before taking action or giving advice.
2. **Safe File Editing (Anti-Truncation Rule)**:
   - When updating large existing files (`architecture.md`, `services.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`), do NOT blindly replace from line 1.
   - Always run `git diff --stat` before committing to ensure no content was accidentally wiped out.
3. **Keep `docs/services.md` and `docs/architecture.md` in Sync**:
   - When a service or storage mount is added, removed, or remapped, immediately update the table in `docs/services.md` or `docs/architecture.md`.

### 🔄 4. GIT SYNC LIFECYCLE
### Fast Git Commits
- Git config (Maja / suryatmaja.dev@gmail.com) is already permanently configured.
- NEVER check `gh api`, `gh auth`, or inspect other repos before committing.
- Commit directly: `git add <specific-code-files> && git commit -m "..." && git push`
- NEVER stage or diff media/binary directories (`media/`, video files, etc.).

1. **Start of Task**: Run `git pull` before reading or modifying anything.
2. **End of Task**:
   - Verify server is healthy and change works.
   - Log entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
   - Clear lock in `CURRENT_OPS.md`.
   - Run `git add <files>`, commit as user Maja (`git config user.name "Maja" && git config user.email "suryatmaja.dev@gmail.com"`), and push:
     `git commit -m "<type>: <concise description>" && git push`
   - Never add `Co-Authored-By` trailers.

## Modes of operation

### 1. Planning mode
- **Homelab infrastructure planning**: Hardware capacity, service architecture trade-offs, scaling roadmap.
- **Operational planning**: Deciding what to automate next, flagging stale docs.
- **In planning mode: discuss first, don't execute.** Only write to `docs/decisions.md` and/or `docs/roadmap.md` once something is actually decided. Never touch live server config in this mode.

### 2. Setup mode
When asked to install/configure something new:
1. `git pull` & check `CURRENT_OPS.md`.
2. Register lock in `CURRENT_OPS.md`.
3. SSH into server, execute setup via batched commands.
4. Save docker-compose file to `configs/docker-compose/<service-name>.yml`.
5. Update `docs/services.md` (port, purpose, data location).
6. Update `docs/architecture.md` if topology changed.
7. Clear lock in `CURRENT_OPS.md`, log in `CHANGELOG.md`, commit and push.

### 3. Maintenance mode
When asked to check/fix/troubleshoot:
1. `git pull` & check `CURRENT_OPS.md`.
2. SSH in, check logs (`docker logs --tail 50`, `journalctl`, etc.).
3. Diagnose issue, explain what's wrong before fixing.
4. Ask before making any destructive change (e.g. deleting volumes, stopping active production containers).
5. Apply fix, verify live state.
6. Clear lock in `CURRENT_OPS.md`, log in `CHANGELOG.md`, commit and push.

### 4. Automation mode
When asked to automate a recurring task:
1. Write script in `scripts/`.
2. Set up cron job or systemd timer.
3. Document in `docs/services.md`.
4. Clear lock in `CURRENT_OPS.md`, log in `CHANGELOG.md`, commit and push.

## Execution preference
When Superpowers reaches the execution phase, always use `executing-plans`
(inline, single-context) instead of `subagent-driven-development`, unless
explicitly told otherwise. This keeps token usage lower for infrastructure
tasks that are typically straightforward.

---

## Storage Convention Reminder
- OS, Docker engine, images, project code, and DB metadata live on internal SSD (`/`).
- Bulk media lives on dedicated external HDDs:
  - `/mnt/hdd-music/`: Music library (Jellyfin) + fallback backup target
  - `/mnt/hdd-media/`: Movies/TV, anime, manga-raw, manga-reader (Komga), torrent downloads
  - `/mnt/hdd-cloud/`: Nextcloud data, Syncthing, shared LAN SMB drop

## 🎵 Music Library Standards (`hdd-backup` & `hdd-music`)
Full specifications are recorded in [`docs/music-standards.md`](docs/music-standards.md). ALL AI agents MUST enforce these rules when ingesting, downloading, moving, or reorganizing albums in `Lossless/` or `Lossy/`:

1. **Zero Loose Albums Rule**: Every single album/single must reside inside an official canonical artist or franchise folder ending with `~` (e.g. `Anime/THE IDOLM@STER ~/`, `J-Pop/＊Luna ~/`). Never place loose albums in category roots (`Anime`, `Doujinshi`, `J-Pop`, `Vtuber`, `Vocaloid`, `Global`).
2. **Strict Hierarchy Compliance**: Always inspect and respect established franchise subseries before dropping files. If a franchise has canonical subfolders, new albums MUST be placed in their matching subfolder (e.g. `THE IDOLM@STER ~/シャイニーカラーズ/01. Song for Prism Series/`, `Uma Musume ~/01. WINNING LIVE Series/`, or `Gakumas/01. Solo/[Idol]/`). Never leave unparented albums at the franchise root.
3. **Consistent Album Folder Naming**:
   - Universal pattern: `[YYYY.MM.DD] [Artist] - [Title] [Format]` (or franchise-specific convention like Gakumas `[Artist] - [Title] [Format]`).
   - Format tag is mandatory: e.g. `[FLAC]`, `[FLAC 96kHz／24bit]`, `[FLAC+BK]`, `[MP3 320k]`.
4. **Flat Album Root (Zero Nested Audio)**:
   - Audio tracks (`.flac`, `.mp3`) must always sit directly in the album folder. Never create nested `FLAC/`, `WAV/`, or `MP3/` folders. Only `BK/` (booklet scans) and `Disc 1/`, `Disc 2/` (for multi-disc releases) are permitted subdirectories.
5. **Track Naming & Metadata Integrity**:
   - Track files must follow `01. [Title].[ext]` or `01 - [Artist] - [Title].[ext]`. Never leave raw store IDs (mora `1-0007...`) or unnamed tracks. Embedded Vorbis/ID3 tags (`TITLE`, `ARTIST`, `ALBUM`, `TRACKNUMBER`) must be filled and accurate.
6. **No Redundant Disc Images / WAVs**:
   - Split single-file WAV/FLAC images with CUE into individual standalone tracks. Delete redundant whole-disc images when split tracks exist.
7. **Windows SMB Safe Naming**: Never use characters forbidden in Windows NTFS/FAT (`\ / : * ? " < > |`) in folder or file names. Use full-width equivalents (e.g. `＊` instead of `*`, remove colons `:` or use full-width `：`) to prevent Samba 8.3 DOS name mangling (`_FCR9Q~X`, `_P6X4P~L`).
8. **Zero Junk Policy**: Strip piracy forum links (`.url`), downloader `.txt` ads (`Read.txt`, `Discord.txt`, etc.), and duplicate lowercase cover files (`cover.jpg` when `Cover.jpg` exists).
9. **Ownership & Master Catalog**:
   - Apply `chown -R 100000:100000` and `chmod -R 775` (dirs) / `664` (files) on new additions so SMB users have immediate access.
   - Always run `python3 /mnt/hdd-backup/music/scripts/update_catalog.py` (or repository `scripts/update_catalog.py`) to refresh `catalog.sqlite`.
10. **Universal Reorganization Framework (Pure Album & Romaji Artist)**:
    - Follow [`docs/music-standards.md#5-universal-music-folder-reorganization-framework-standard-operating-procedure`](docs/music-standards.md#5-universal-music-folder-reorganization-framework-standard-operating-procedure) for every batch cleanup.
    - **Artist Folder**: Japanese names must strictly follow `Romaji (Kanji/Hira/Kana) ~` (e.g. `Aoki Hina (青木陽菜) ~`).
    - **Album Folder**: Must be pure album title without date tags (`[YYYY.MM.DD]`), without years `(2025)`, and without audio codecs/bitrates (`[FLAC 24bit/48kHz]`, `[WEB-FLAC]`).
11. **Canonical Franchise Umbrellas & Anti-Split Policy**:
    - Multimedia/anime/game releases MUST reside inside their designated umbrella in `Anime/` using strictly `Romaji/Global (Japanese Text) ~` format (e.g. `THE IDOLM@STER (アイドルマスター) ~`, `Uma Musume (ウマ娘) ~`, `BanG Dream! (バンドリ！) ~`, `Bocchi the Rock! (結束バンド／ぼっち・ざ・ろっく！) ~`, `Girls Band Cry (ガールズバンドクライ) ~`, `Denonbu (電音部) ~`, `Arknights (アークナイツ／塞壬唱片-MSR) ~`, dll.).
    - Never allow fragmented split folders (e.g. `Arknight ~` vs `アークナイツ ~`, `DENONBU ~` vs `電音部 ~`). Always merge into the canonical `Romaji (Japanese) ~` folder defined in [`docs/music-standards.md`](docs/music-standards.md).
